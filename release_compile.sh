# This is a simple "packaging" utility that executes Make and installs the
# output binaries in a "deployment" folder.
#
# Fell free to customize this to your own development/testing environment
#
# Usage:
#
#   ./release_compile.sh <type>
#
# ...where <type> can take any of the following values:
#
#  - "cvs"
#      The tools will be built and installed in "$RELEASE_FOLDER/<version_tag>",
#      but only if that folder did not already existed (otherwise, it won't do
#      anything)
#
#  - "VersionXXX" (ex: "VersionA7", "VersionB13", ...)
#      The tools will be built and installed in
#      "$RELEASE_FOLDER/VersionXXX/<version_tag>", wiping a previous folder with
#      the same name in case it existed.
#
# In both cases, "<version_tag>" is the value contained in the first line of
# file "version.txt" and it must have the following format:
#
#   lowercase "i" + monotonically increasing number
#
# Examples: i145, i146, i147, ....
#
# The last line of output produced by this script will always contain two words:
#   1. The HASH of the current git commit
#   2. The path to the folder where the release has been installed.
