// Process BBF TLVs included in the incoming CMDU structure
//
// This function allows to parse the new TLVs defined in the BBF community.
// According to the standard, any CMDU is subject to be extended with extra
// Vendor Specific TLVs, so each inserted BBF TLV will be embedded inside a
// Vendor Specific TLV.
// This implementation will only process defined BBF TLVs embedded inside a
// Vendor Specific TLV whose OUI is the BBF one (0x00256d)
//
// 'memory_structure' is the CMDU structure
//
// Return '0' if there was a problem, '1' otherwise
