// A given neighbor might be "reachable" in several ways:
//   - Just from one local interface (typical case)
//   - From one local interface *but* in two remote interfaces (ex: the remote
//     interface is connected to a HUB where two remote interfaces from one same
//     neighbor are connected)
//   - From several interfaces, each of them connected with one or more remote
//     interfaces.
//
// This function returns all the ways a neighbor is reachable:
//   - The output argument 'links_nr' contains the number of ways the neighbor
//     can be reached.
//   - The output argument 'interfaces' is an array of 'links_nr' pointers to
//     strings, each of them containing the name of a local interface (ex:
//     "eth0")
//   - The returned pointer contains 'links_nr' MAC addresses that correspond to
//     interfaces in the provided neighbour.
//
//  So, for example, if we have this:
//
//      eth0 -------------- eth0

//      eth1 ---- HUB ----- eth1

//  ...and we are "A", then the following calls will return the following
//  results:
//
//    - DMgetListOfLinkswithNeighbor(B):
//        ret        = [<B_eth0_addr>, <B_eth1_addr>]
//        interfaces = ["eth0",        "eth1"]

//        ret        = [<C_eth0_addr>]
//        interfaces = ["eth1"]
//        links_nr   = 1
//
// 
// The returned pointers, once they are no longer needed, must be freed by the
// caller with "DMfreeListOfLinksWithNeighbor()". Example:

//   INT8U (*ret)[6];
//   char **interfaces;
//   INT8U links_nr;
//
//   ret = DMgetListOfLinksWithNeighbor(neighbor_al_mac_address, &interfaces, &links_nr);
//
//   <use it...>

//

// (Global) network topology related functions
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Update a "device" entry in the data model.
//
// Call this function every time new information regarding one network device
// is received (ie.  when receiving either a "topology response", a "generic
// phy response" or a "high layer response" message).
//
// As you can see, this function takes many arguments. You don't need to provide
// all of them at the same time (just leave the ones you don't want to update
// set to NULL and their associated "*_update" value set to "0").
// For example, when receiving a "generic phy response" message you will only
// want to update the "genericPhyDeviceInformationTypeTLV" structure, thus you
// would call this function like this:
//
//   DMupdateNetworkDeviceInfo(al_mac_address,
//                             0, NULL,
//                             0, NULL, 0,
//                             0, NULL, 0,
//                             0, NULL, 0,
//                             0, NULL, 0,
//                             0, NULL, 0,
//                             1, generic_phy,
//                             0, NULL,
//                             0, NULL,
//                             0, NULL, 0);
//
// The "*_update" argument is needed because sometimes you want to update
// something to be NULL (for example, when something disappears from the
// network)
//
// Note that for certain types of TLVs the data model can only contain *one*
// of them ("deviceInformationTypeTLV", "genericPhyDeviceInformationTypeTLV",
// "x1905ProfileVersionTLV", "deviceInformationTypeTLV" and
// "deviceInformationTypeTLV").
// For these TLVs you only need to provide a pointer to the structure.
//
// For all the others the data model might contain more than one element. That's
// why you need to provide a pointer to a list of elements and its length.
//
//   NOTE: The 1905 standard allows for more than one "powerOffInterfaceTLV"
//   and "l2NeighborDeviceTLV" TLVs to be received in the "topology response"
//   message, and that's why I require a pointer to a list (and its length) for
//   them. HOWEVER, this is probably an error in the standard (particularly in
//   "Section 6.3.3" after the corrections included in the 1a revision) because
//   one single of these is more than enough as it can contain as many
//   "subentries" (for the particular items they list) as desired.
//   If this is corrected in future revisions of the standard, I just need to
//   change the prototype of this function to accept regular pointers for
//   "power_off" and "l2_neighbors" (instead of pointers to pointers) and remove
//   their associated "power_off_nr" and "l2_neighbors_nr" variables.
//
// The only parameter you *must* provide is the first one, which identifies the
// 1905 node that is going to be udpated (or created, if this is the first time
// this node is being used in a call to this function).
//
// The pointers this function receives become its responsability, thus the
// caller must not free them at any point (they will automatically be freed the
// next time this function is called with new (updated) data)
//
//   NOTE: For metrics, a different function is used
//        ("DMupdateNetworkDeviceMetrics()"). The reason for this is that
//        "metrics" work in a slighlty different way: they are not overwritten
//        as a whole (as all the TLVs in this function are) every time they are
//        updated... instead only the "matching" (ie. same origin and
//        destination) metric is.
//        In other words:
//          - When using THIS function, every time you provide a new pointer to
//            a TLV, the data model is updated to contain that TLV (and free the
//            old one)
//          - When using "DMupdateNetworkDeviceMetrics()", every time you
//            provide a new pointer, the data model is updated to *add* it to
//            the already existing metrics information (unless it refers to an
//            already existing link, in which case it is updated)
//
//  TODO: Would it be worth to merge these functions in the future?
//            
// Return '0' if there was a problem, '1' otherwise
