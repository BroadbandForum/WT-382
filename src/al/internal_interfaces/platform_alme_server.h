// A RESPONSE/CONFIRMATION that is produced as a result of a previous REQUEST,
// contains the same 'alme_client_id' as the one the REQUEST originally inserted
// in the messages queue (as explained in the "PLATFORM_REGISTER_QUEUE_EVENT()"

//
// 'alme_message' is a pointer to the ALME payload and is 'alme_message_len'

//
// Return '0' if there was some problem processing the RESPONSE/CONFIRMATION,
